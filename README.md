Scripts
=============

Scripts I wrote or adopted to make my life easier. 

Most of them I copied into /usr/bin/ so those commands can be easily used in terminal modus.

Feel free to adopt, change and create issues for them.

icinga.sh
---------

This script can be used to display the output of icinga on your desktop conky setup. 

Usage in conkyrc configfile:

  ${execpi 53 ~/.conky/icinga.sh}

encryptation.sh
---------------

This script I use to decrypt multipe dropbox accounts using encfs for work related data, personal data and evolution data.

More information can be found on http://www.visibilityspots.com/dropbox/

shares.sh
---------

I use a network share on an iomega boxee device as a central place for all my data (pictures, movies, music and random data)

To easily mount and umount those shares I wrote this script.
